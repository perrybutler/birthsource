BirthSource
===========

BirthSource is the social platform behind BirthSource.info. The current platform architecture consists of a custom theme for WordPress (a content management system) primarily due to the ease of use in regards to the target demographic.

Development is funded by a Knowledge Translation grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

**Programmed from the ground up; every feature/component is a first-class citizen:**

* OpenID/OAuth 2.0 login system with IP-based throttling that integrates with the WordPress core users system.
* Custom post type integrates "Birth Links" for user-submitted content.
* 7-criteria rating system for all Birth Links (frontend).
* Advanced AJAX sorting/filtering for all Birth Links (frontend).
* Likert scale/5-star rating widgets.
* Comment voting (up/down similar to reddit.com) that integrates with the WordPress core comments system.
* Frontend integration of traditionally backend-only features such as a custom Edit Profile page and a custom Insert Post (Add a Link) page.
